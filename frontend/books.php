                    a Midwesterner recently arrived in New York City, spends with his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband, Tom, a wealthy Midwesterner. Nick is drawn into the world of the Buchanans,

                    Anna Karenina is a novel by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, published in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger.
                    Tolstoy clashed with editor Mikhail Katkov over political issues that arose in the final installment; the novel's publication was then delayed until 1877.
                    The first 53 chapters are set in the 1870s, in St.Petersburg and Moscow, and cover the affairs of the Levin family and the Oblonskys, and the love affair between Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky. The last six
                    chapters take place in 1879 and 1880, and describe events that take place after Anna's departure from Moscow.

                        intersecting stories with many characters.[1] Issues include the status of women, the nature of marriage, idealism,
                        self-interest, religion, hypocrisy, political reform, and education. Despite comic elements, Middlemarch uses realism to
                        encompass historical events: the 1832 Reform Act, early railways, and the accession of King William IV.

                        the most famous example being the "episode of the madeleine". The novel was first published in serial form between 1913 and 1927

                        is considered by critics to be one of the most important works of 20th-century fiction.
